#Spongebob Escapes from Bikini Bottom

##Game Objects
  1.###Platforms
    *Platforms will be what Spongebob jumps on to advance forward towards the surface.
    *As Spongebob moves upward, the platforms move downward when his velocity is positive. Otherwise, they stay in place.

  2.###Jellyfish
    *Jellyfish are enemies, and they sit on platforms and wobble back and forth.
    *They move along with platforms, so when Spongebob's velocity is positive, jellyfish move downward.

  3.###Bubbles
    *Bubbles are powerups. When Spongebob hits one, they boost him up in a stream of bubbles for a limited time and boost his velocity.
    *Bubbles will either sit on platforms or move back and forth across the screen until Spongebob hits it or moves off the screen.

  4.###Shield (Pencil)
    *When Spongebob holds the pencil, he is invincible to jellyfish and Patrick Star.
    *The pencil sits on top of a platform and moves with the platform.
    *The pencil disappears after a few seconds of activation.

  5.###Patrick Star
    *Patrick Star is the main enemy. He moves slowly back and forth, up and down in the screen.
    *He exits the scene when Spongebob moves high enough as he pushes Patrick down.

##Game Play
  *Gameplay is simple. All it involves is avoiding the enemies and trying to go as far as possible.
  *Shooting the enemies might be implemented later...

###Controls
  *Left-Right arrows move Spongebob back and forth
  *P pauses the game
  *Spacebar might shoot projectiles from Spongebob in a future version

###Score
  *Score is calculated by how high Spongebob gets. So every y-coord increase increases the score by one.
  *You can gain extra points by eliminating enemies.

###Goals and Lives
  *You only have one life, so if you hit an enemy or miss a platform, you die.
  *Your goal is to try and get to the surface and achieve a high score.
